# DrakeTutorials
Trying to put together a bunch of minimal working examples for 'RobotLocomotion/drake' Model-Based Design and Verification for Robotics.

All Tutorials in this Repo will be in Python.

I am targetting new users, as it can be quite difficult to start diving in.


Starting with:

- Exhaustive Look into the functions in each Namespace, with minimal working examples in Python
       Everything from how to call AutoDiffXD version of math.sin() to setting up a LeafSystem...

001 : Load via URDF, SDF, Mujoco, Build manipulator equations,
         invert Mass matrix, build state space symbolic rep.
         
002  : Multibody plant: setup and Python API
